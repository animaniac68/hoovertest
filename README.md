This terminal program requires node.js installation
please click on this link https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to download to your machine.

This program allows you to navigate a hoover (like a Roomba) in a rectangle room.
The room is based on a grid where co-ordinates are X Y
The size of the room is 5 x 5 where the bottom left corner is 0 0.

There are also locations of the patches of dirt defined by X Y co-ordinates and an initial hoover position.

You can navigate the hoover using cardinal directions where N = North, E = East, S = South and W = West.

There is an attatched file called input.txt where line 1 = grid size, line 2 = hoover's initial location. line 3 - 5 are the patches of dirt and line 6 are the commands to move the hoover accross the grid.
